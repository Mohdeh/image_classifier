# image_classifier
In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow. Then I convert it into a command line application.  In order to complete this project, I use GPU-enabled workspaces (running on local CPU will likely not work well due to computationally-intensive deep neural network). Data for this project is quite large. In fact, it is so large we cannot upload it onto Github. If one would like the data for this project, it should be downloaded. Completing the project is likely not possible on local unless it is equipped with a GPU. I train using 102 different types of flowers, where there are ~20 images per flower to train on. Subsequently, I use my trained classifier to see if I can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
